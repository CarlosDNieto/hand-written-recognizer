# Hand Written Digits Recognizer

This is a replicated model from [neuralnet.ai](https://github.com/neuralnetai) from this [repo](https://github.com/neuralnetai/hand-drawn-digits). I found this at a Medium articlu you can find [here](https://medium.com/@neuralnet.ai/tensorflow-js-building-a-drawable-handwritten-digits-classifier-d85beb858874).


My objective is to improve the performance of the algorithm changing the CNN to a fully connected network.
